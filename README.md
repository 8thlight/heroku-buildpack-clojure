# Heroku buildpack: Clojure

This is a Heroku buildpack for Clojure apps. It uses
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

Note that you don't have to do anything special to use this buildpack
with Clojure apps on Heroku; it will be used by default for all
projects containing a project.clj file, though it may be an older
revision than current master. This repository is made available so
users can fork for their own needs and contribute patches back.

## Usage

Example usage for an app already stored in git:

    $ tree
    |-- Procfile
    |-- project.clj
    |-- README
    `-- src
        `-- sample
            `-- core.clj

    $ heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure.git

    $ git push heroku master
    ...

The buildpack will detect your app as Clojure if it has a
`project.clj` file in the root. If you use the
[clojure-maven-plugin](https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin),
[the standard Java buildpack](http://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java)
should work instead.

This buildpack will call `LEIN_NO_DEV=y lein deps` to copy your
dependencies into the `lib` directory.

## Private Repositories

If you have dependencies which cannot be published to any public Maven
repository, you can use the
[s3-wagon-private](https://github.com/technomancy/s3-wagon-private)
plugin to publish and consume from private repositories hosted on S3.

Currently this requires installing `s3-wagon-private` as a user-level
plugin locally and using the `s3-wagon` branch of the Clojure buildpack:

    $ lein plugin install s3-wagon-private 1.0.0
    $ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=git@github.com:heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure.git#s3-wagon

Future versions of Leiningen will allow you to declare
`s3-wagon-private` in `project.clj`, but for the time being you may
want to include this warning so you will get more helpful error
messages when it's missing:

```clj
(try (resolve 's3.wagon.private.PrivateWagon)
     (catch java.lang.ClassNotFoundException _
       (println "WARNING: You appear to be missing s3-private-wagon.")
       (println "To install it: lein plugin install s3-private-wagon 1.0.0")))
```

It's [recommended](http://www.12factor.net/config) to keep your
repository credentials out of source control. You'll need to
[enable user_env_compile](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-user-env-compile)
for your app to expose config variables at compile time:

    $ heroku plugins:install http://github.com/heroku/heroku-labs.git # if needed
    $ heroku labs:enable user_env_compile

Then you can add the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` config values:

    $ heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY=[...] AWS_SECRET_KEY=[...]

Finally you'll need to read these values into Leiningen. You can
either embed calls to `System/getenv` into project.clj directly or
check in a `.lein-heroku-init.clj` file that will be copied to
`~/.lein/init.clj` in the slug compilation environment.

```clj
(def leiningen-auth {"s3p://secret-bucket/releases"
                     {:username (System/getenv "AWS_ACCESS_KEY")
                      :passphrase (System/getenv "AWS_SECRET_KEY")}})
```

## Hacking

To change this buildpack, fork it on GitHub. Push up changes to your
fork, then create a test app with `--buildpack YOUR_GITHUB_URL` and
push to it. If you already have an existing app you may use
`heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=YOUR_GITHUB_URL` instead.

For example, you could adapt it to generate an uberjar at build time.

Open `bin/compile` in your editor, and replace the block labeled
"fetch deps with lein" with something like this:

    echo "-----> Generating uberjar with Leiningen:"
    echo "       Running: LEIN_NO_DEV=y lein uberjar"
    cd $BUILD_DIR
    PATH=.lein/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx500m -Duser.home=$BUILD_DIR" LEIN_NO_DEV=y lein uberjar 2>&1 | sed -u 's/^/       /'
    if [ "${PIPESTATUS[*]}" != "0 0" ]; then
      echo " !     Failed to create uberjar with Leiningen"
      exit 1
    fi

The `LEIN_NO_DEV` environment variable will cause Leiningen to keep
the test directories and dev dependencies off the classpath, so be
sure to set it for every `lein` invocation.

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your GitHub fork,
then push your sample app to Heroku to test. You should see:
